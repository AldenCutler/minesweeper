# ðŸš© Minesweeper ðŸš©

This is my attempt at re-creating minesweeper. I've been a fan of the game for a while so I used my knowledge of how Minesweeper works to create this Python program using pygame. All graphics were found online. I would recommend using a Python version no older than 3.11.3 since that is what I used to write this.

## To Run

1. Download this repository to your local machine by either using ```git clone https://github.com/AldenCutler/minesweeper``` or by downloading as a compressed folder then unzipping.
2. Run the ```main.py``` program in the downloaded folder.

## Issues or Bugs

If you run into any bugs in my code please let me know so I can fix it. I'm open to any suggestions as well :)
