# minesweeper
I randomly decided to recreate MineSweeper for fun. I didn't follow any tutorials, I'm just pretty experienced with the game and used that experience to recreate the logic. The game was created using Python and Pygame because I'm comfortable with those tools, but I'd like to expand to other languages and platforms as well.
